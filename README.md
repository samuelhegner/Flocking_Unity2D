# Flocking_Unity2D
## Project Description
The project implements Craig Reynolds' flocking algorithm in 2D using Unity. The flocking behaviour emerges based on three simple rules of Cohesion, Separation and Alignment. To achieve high numbers of boid/agents the simulation is implemented using the Unity Jobs System and Burst compiler. This allows for simulation of up to 5000 agents at a fast frame rate.
